Welcome to REACH project technical documentation
================================================


To take a leading position on Data Economy, Europe is placing focus on breaking "data silos", 
and accessing, sharing and reusing data, still ensuring that this happens in a secured and trusted manner. 
For that, the European Commission is supporting pilot projects and innovation spaces to allow experimentation 
on cross-sector multi-stakeholder data innovation.

`REACH <https://www.reach-incubator.eu/>`_ is a European-wide second-generation incubator for data-fuelled start-ups & SMEs 
that aims to facilitate the development of trusted and secure innovative solutions based on industrial and personal data.

Within the incubation program, `REACH <https://www.reach-incubator.eu/>`_ offers free infrastructure and tools for selected subgrantees.
At this site, the documentation for the different infrastructures and tools is collected.
