Smart Contracts Formal Verifier
===============================

Goal
----

The Smart Contracts Formal Verifier can be used to verify that a smart contract
follow the behavior envisionned by its creator. This behavior is expressed
through formal specifications.

Since it exists numerous smart-contract language, we choose to use an existing
framework Why3 used for proving algorithm. The main advantage is to already
benefit from state of the art ways to specify, and prove the correctness of the
program. the compilation to the smart-contract language is usualy done in a
straightforward way.
