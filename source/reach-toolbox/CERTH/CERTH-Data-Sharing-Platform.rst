Overview of CERTH Data Sharing Platform
=======================================

CERTH/ITI has designed a Platform for enabling the data sharing and data permission management using a proposed smart contract hierarchy. The platform tackles also with the problem of data integrity verification which lies under the data quality issue that should be addressed by the REACH toolkit. 

The combination of the data integrity verification and the fact that only pointers/references to the data are stored in the Blockchain, render the Platform compliant with GDPR by design. The Platform is currently under development and will be extended/adapted to meet the needs of REACH stakeholders.

Getting access to the Infrastructure

Tool for Data Providers
-----------------------
Data providers wishing to share their data with data consumers in a secure way, use a blockchain network with deployed Solidity smart contracts to store the fingerprints of the data assets for integrity verification, as well as reference to the data so that authenticated users can access them.

Tool for Data Consumers
-----------------------
Data consumers searching for relevant data and wishing to check its integrity, use a blockchain network with deployed Solidity smart contracts to search for the data based on a set of criteria and also to verify their integrity.
