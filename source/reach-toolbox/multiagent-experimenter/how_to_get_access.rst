How to get access
=============================

As the tool is still under development, access to MAX will be done with the use of a .jar file sent by making the request.  To do so, please contact us by mail to (URL) and provide a list of firstname/lastname/email/company name and country for each user. The access will be created and each user will receive the confirmation by mail with the files needed.

N.B: Note that the tool's open-source release has been approved and is scheduled for 2021.
