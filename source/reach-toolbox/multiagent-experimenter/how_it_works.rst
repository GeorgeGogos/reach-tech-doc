How it works
=============================

MAX (for ‘Multi-Agent eXperimenter’) is a framework for agent-based simulation and full agent-based applications building. MAX runs on the Java virtual machine, so it works on all major platforms (MacOS, Windows, Linux, et al). It can run as a desktop application and a command line application. The requirements to use MAX are Java (11+) and an IDE.

Since MAX is modular, two aspects of working with MAX will be detailed here: Executing an existing model and developing a new model.
