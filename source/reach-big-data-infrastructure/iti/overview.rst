`Datahub <https://datahub.iti.upv.es/>`_ is the framework that ITI offers you to do your experiments. It is composed of a cluster computing with two differentiate environments:

1. An infrastructure environment based on Openstack  for Big Data and AI solutions. 
2. An infrastructure environment with high-performance computing capabilities intended for solutions that require compute intensive workloads and intensive operations and, therefore, GPUs usage.
