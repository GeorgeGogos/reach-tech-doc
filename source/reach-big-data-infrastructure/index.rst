REACH Big Data Infrastructure
=============================

Introduction
------------

`REACH <https://www.reach-incubator.eu/>`_ is an Innovation Action (IA) which provides 
incubated companies with a Big Data infrastructure to host their experimentations and facilitate 
the development of data-fuelled solutions in short time. REACH Big Data infrastructure is provided by 
three different Digital Innovation Hubs: ITI, CEA and DEUSTO.
Each DIH provides their own toolset, although there
will be a set of core tools common to them (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). 
This Big Data stack will be provided to subgrantees applying to Open Calls during the Experiment and Evolve stages. 

Although the Big Data infrastructure focuses on providing the computational resources and tools for the data
processing, the subgrantees are free to deploy their own applications on top of the provided infrastructure, for example,
specific databases, indexes, APIs or web interfaces. Therefore, the project offers different frameworks to allow
subgrantees deploying their own applications and tools (i.e., virtual machine access and Kubernetes cluster access).
